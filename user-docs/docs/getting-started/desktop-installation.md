# Desktop Installation Walkthrough

This walkthrough takes you from installing Git to opening Lumiverse on Windows or macOS. For Linux, Docker, and the full configuration reference, see [Installation](installation.md). For Android, use the [Termux walkthrough](android-installation.md).

## 1. Install Git

=== "Windows"

    Open **PowerShell** in Windows Terminal. Use PowerShell throughout this walkthrough.

    ```powershell
    winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
    ```

    If `winget` is unavailable, download the installer from [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).

    Close PowerShell completely, reopen it, and check:

    ```powershell
    git --version
    ```

=== "macOS"

    Open **Terminal** and check:

    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

    If Git is missing, install Apple's command-line tools and wait for installation to finish:

    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```

    Run `git --version` again before continuing.

## 2. Choose a folder and download Lumiverse

Choose a folder you own and can write to. Keep the checkout out of Windows system folders such as `C:\Windows\System32`. The commands below create a `Lumiverse` folder inside your home folder.

=== "Windows"

    ```powershell
    Set-Location $HOME
    git clone https://github.com/prolix-oc/Lumiverse.git
    Set-Location Lumiverse
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/prolix-oc/Lumiverse.git
    cd Lumiverse
    ```

If you already have a checkout, open your terminal in that folder instead of cloning again.

## 3. Start Lumiverse

=== "Windows"

    If PowerShell blocks script execution, run:

    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```

    Then launch from the Lumiverse folder:

    ```powershell
    .\start.ps1
    ```

=== "macOS"

    ```bash
    chmod +x start.sh
    ./start.sh
    ```

The launcher installs Bun if needed, installs dependencies, and opens the first-run setup wizard. Follow its prompts to create your owner account and configure the server. Leave the terminal running while using Lumiverse.

## 4. Open Lumiverse

Open `http://localhost:7860` in your browser. If you selected a different port during setup, use that port instead. Sign in with the account you created, then follow [First Steps](first-steps.md) to connect an AI provider and start a chat.

## Open it again later

Open a terminal in the same Lumiverse folder and run the same start command. You do not need to clone again or repeat setup.

On Windows, you can also save this as `Start Lumiverse.bat`. It assumes the home-folder location used above; change the path if you installed elsewhere.

```bat
@echo off
cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\Lumiverse" || exit /b 1
powershell -File .\start.ps1
pause
```

For an optional tray application, see [Experimental Lumiverse Desktop](desktop-tray.md).
