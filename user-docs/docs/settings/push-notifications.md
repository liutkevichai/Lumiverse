# Notifications

Lumiverse can send system notifications to your devices when certain events happen — like when a character finishes responding. This is useful when you're multitasking, using the PWA on mobile, or running Lumiverse Desktop.

!!! warning "HTTPS or localhost required in a browser"
    Browser push notifications rely on Service Workers, which most browsers only allow in **secure contexts**. This means browser delivery will only work when accessing Lumiverse via:

    - **`localhost`** — Always treated as secure, even without SSL
    - **HTTPS** — A reverse proxy with a valid SSL certificate (e.g., `https://lumiverse.example.com`)

    If you're accessing Lumiverse in a browser over plain HTTP on a remote IP (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:7860`), browser push will not be available. Lumiverse Desktop uses its native notification bridge instead of Service Worker push.

## Setting Up

1. Open **Settings > Notifications**
2. Toggle **Enable push notifications**
3. Click **Enable** for this device (your browser or operating system will ask for notification permission)
4. Grant permission when prompted

Each device must be subscribed individually. You can manage all your registered devices from this settings tab.

Lumiverse Desktop registers as a native destination. Its device identity and revocable enrollment credential are stored in the operating system's per-app configuration directory, so rebuilding or updating the desktop bundle does not require you to sign in again just to keep receiving notifications. The credential is pinned to that server's origin and identity; removing the destination in Settings revokes it.

## Notification Events

| Event | Notification |
|-------|-------------|
| **Generation completed** | Character name as title, first 120 characters of the response as body |
| **Generation failed** | Connection name in the title, with the error code and message in the body |

Each event type can be enabled or disabled independently.

## Visibility Gating

Automatic notifications are **suppressed when you're actively viewing the app on any connected device**. For example, keeping Lumiverse visible on your laptop suppresses notifications to your phone. They resume when all connected sessions are hidden or closed.

The per-device **test notification** deliberately bypasses this visibility check so you can verify delivery while the Settings page is open.

A notification already sent while you were away may still arrive just after you reopen the app.

---

## Device Management

From the Notifications settings tab:

- View all registered devices
- Remove individual device subscriptions
- Send a **test notification** to verify everything works

Browser subscriptions that stop accepting notifications are automatically cleaned up. A desktop destination can be removed from Settings to revoke its durable credential.

## Tips

!!! tip "Great for mobile PWA"
    Add Lumiverse to your home screen and enable notifications. You'll get alerts when the AI responds, even when the app is in the background.

!!! tip "Use with long generations"
    If you're using a slow model or generating very long responses, notifications let you switch to other tasks and come back when the response is ready.
