title: Image Generation

# Image Generation

Lumiverse generates scene illustrations, character shots, and chat attachments from your conversations. It can run a hands-off **Scene tool** that watches your chat and refreshes the background as the setting shifts, or accept a **custom prompt** you write yourself — with full preset and macro support.

---

## Finding the controls

Open **Image Gen** in the sidebar. The drawer keeps the choices for your next generation together: connection, mode, output, active main prompt preset (in Custom or Chat-aware Custom mode), active LoRA preset, and **Quick Behavior**. Progress, the last scene, previews, **Generate Now**, and **Force Generate** stay here too.

Deep editing opens in a modal:

| Entry point | What it contains |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Edit** beside the prompt preset / **Prompt Studio…** in Scene mode | Main, Character, and Persona preset editors, a shared Parser tab, and separate Captioning preset/parser controls. |
| **Edit** beside the LoRA preset | **LoRA Studio**: ordered LoRA rows, strengths, base tags, preset save/delete, bypass controls, and strength scale. |
| **Configure Generation…** | **Generation Settings**: provider parameters and models, source images where supported, automation, background display, and timeouts. |
| **Caption Image** | Upload an image to generate descriptive tags with the existing captioner. |
| **Export / Import** | Import or export image-generation configuration from the centered utility row beside **Caption Image**. Available even while image generation is disabled. |

**Done** closes an editor. Provider parameters and behavior settings persist as you change them; Done does not perform a separate save. Prompt and LoRA presets have their own explicit save actions. Closing and reopening a studio while the drawer remains mounted preserves its current draft.

## How It Works

1. You pick a **prompt mode** — Scene tool, Custom, or Chat-aware Custom.
2. Lumiverse builds the final prompt (running the parser/scene LLM if needed and substituting any character / persona snippets).
3. The active **image-gen connection** generates the image.
4. The result is routed to the **output target** you chose — background, new chat image, or attached to the last message — and optionally linked into the character gallery.

**Auto-Generate On Reply** triggers generation after replies using the selected mode. In Scene mode, the scene-change check can skip an image when too little has changed. Turn auto-generation off for manual control with **Generate Now**; **Force Generate** bypasses scene detection for one request.

## Prompt Modes

| Mode | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **Scene tool** | A sidecar LLM reads the chat and extracts a structured scene (environment, time of day, weather, mood, focal detail, and — optionally — visible characters and composition). The provider-specific prompt is built from those fields. |
| **Custom prompt** | Your prompt is sent to the image provider verbatim. Macros (`{{user}}`, `{{char}}`, `{{character_prompt}}`, `{{persona_prompt}}`, …) are still resolved. |
| **Chat-aware custom** | Your text becomes _parser instructions_, not the final prompt. A parser LLM rewrites the current chat context into an image prompt following your guidance. |

See [Prompts & Presets](prompts-and-presets.md) for the full picture, including how to save presets and bind them to a character or persona.

## Output Targets

| Target | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Set as background** | Image becomes the chat background at your configured opacity. |
| **Insert into chat** | A new chat message is created with the image as an attachment. |
| **Attach to last message** | The image is appended to the most recent message's attachments. |
| **Preview only** | The image is generated but not placed in the chat — useful for testing a preset. |

Generated images are persisted with thumbnails and a public URL, are addressable from the image gallery, and (when enabled) are automatically linked into the active character's gallery.
